Tipping The Lead Developer
==========================

Bedrock Linux development is not limited by funding.  Providing additional
funds will not have a meaningful effect on the project development pace.
Bedrock Linux, as a project, is not accepting donations.

There is no intended obligation associated with benefiting from Bedrock Linux
development efforts.  Enjoy.

If you would like to make a *personal* tip to the lead developer as a thanks
for his efforts, you may do so [here](https://www.paypal.me/paradigmcomplex).
