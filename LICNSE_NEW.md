=== TODO
Terms to be defined:
- maintainer
- open-source
- incompetent users

Issues:
- Make paid license for users (share funds with paradigm assuming that he learns how to write shell/bash that passes shellcheck)

Regular users are counter-productive -> Make them into a customers so that they are worth the effort to teach them and treat them as human beings.

- Make this free for everyone who contributes in X amount of time


- Allow end-users to submit a bug bounties for funds -> Person who resolves the issues gets the bounty

Bugs with low priority are usually processed slowly, this should speed up the process.
